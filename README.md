# Retail_Analytics
OList, an e-commerce company has faced some losses and wants to manage their inventory very well to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing.

As part of this problem statement analytics, we have to help OList to identify the product categories which they can get rid of without significantly impacting business by providing insights on  :

-- Analysing the inventory cost and providing suggestions to manage cost efficiently by the company

-- Identifying top products that contributes to the revenue

-- Doing a market basket analysis to analyze the purchase behavior of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
